    "*In this assignment, you will explore networks and develop MRJob code for finding shortest path graph distances. To build up to large datasets, you will develop your code on some very simple toy networks. Afte rthis, you will take your developed code and modify it, applying it to two larger datasets (performing EDA along the way).*\n",

    "### Question 7.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "*Write MRJob classes to find the shortest path graph distances as described in the lectures. In addition to finding the distances, your code should also output a distance-minimizing path between the source and target. Work locally for this part of the assignment, and use both of the undirected and directed toy networks.*\n",

    "\n",
    "To accomplish this task, we write two separate MRJob classes. The first of these, `initGraphJob` initializes the graph and assigns a starter node. The second, `ShortestPathJob` actually finds the shortest path between the start and end nodes of choice. \n",

    "This would be the safe difficulty as finding the shortest path (within MRJob). The argument for this is that to find the shortest path from a starting node to an arbitrary node, I have to compute the distance for all other nodes in the graph. In other words, the distance calculation is identical between the two. The difference between the longest and shortest distance implementation is how the stream is parsed. For the former, I look at the largest value in the set, and for the latter the smallest. "
